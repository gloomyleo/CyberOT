## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the OT Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Tool seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainer with details of the vulnerability
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial response
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days, others within 90 days
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

## Security Best Practices
